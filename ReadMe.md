Uploaded the files to github.
Added id Attribute to Search Engine Optimization.
Added Alt text to all images using alt attribute.
Added Title to web page.
Changed headers into a numerical order instead of having multiple h2 and h3. The footer was h2 as well and was changed. Then I changed them back when I remembered what h formatting does. Footer is still h4
Coalesced a lot of the article content and side content into 1 class each as opposed to the 3 separate classes in the css sheet.
Made a lot of mistakes along the way, got help from google and class resources. I think I have everything cleaned up and reorginized in a logical progression.
